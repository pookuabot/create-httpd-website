Create HTTPD/Apache Website and SSL Certificate
===============================================

These scripts will allow you to create a website directory and creates an SSL Certificate for the newly created website.

Make sure you have the following installed on the server  
 * HTTPD or Apache  
 * Let's Encrypt  

Please note, you will need to make sure you have your web domain already configured.  If not, Let's Encrypt will fail due to the A Record missing from your Domain Name.
